# -The-Time-Calculation-puzzle
Problem Statement: You are given two digital clocks, each displaying hours and minutes in the 24-hour format (00:00 to 23:59). One clock runs 2.5 times slower than the other. How long does it take for the clocks to display the same time again? How many times will they display the same time in a 24-hour period?


Solution: Let's consider the slower clock as Clock A and the faster clock as Clock B.

Clock B will complete 24 hours in the same time it takes Clock A to complete 2.5 cycles (2.5 times slower).
The time taken for Clock A to complete one cycle is 24 hours / 2.5 = 9.6 hours.
Therefore, the clocks will display the same time again after 9.6 hours.
In a 24-hour period, Clock A completes 24 hours, while Clock B completes 2.5 cycles, which is equivalent to 2.5 * 9.6 = 24 hours.
Hence, the clocks will display the same time exactly once in a 24-hour period.
